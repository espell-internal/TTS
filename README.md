# TTS
Helps create synthetic voiceover from text in an Excel sheet. 

1:
It uses espell's Azure connections to access our resource called TTS-espell. Go to our Azure to access the necessary key and region, and copy it in the code to activate the connection.

2:
Create an Excel sheet with the following structure: 
  Column A: file name
  Column B: Azure voice you want to read the text
  Column C: the text itself

3: give the Excel file's path and the sheet name to the code, as well as the output path

4: run it via Terminal
